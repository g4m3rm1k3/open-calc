    question: "If differentiation is a linear map and every linear map has a matrix, what does the 'differentiation matrix' look like — and why does it depend on which basis you use for polynomials?",
    realWorldContext: "The same linear transformation can look very different depending on your basis. A rotation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is represented by a rotation matrix in the standard basis, but by a diagonal matrix (just scaling by $e^{i\\theta}$ and $e^{-i\\theta}$) in the basis of complex eigenvectors. This is exactly diagonalization! In signal processing, the DFT changes basis to the Fourier modes, turning convolution (complicated) into pointwise multiplication (simple). In numerical methods, preconditioners change the basis to make the system better conditioned.",

      'Let $T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ be rotation by $90°$ counterclockwise. Where do the standard basis vectors go? $T(\\mathbf{e}_1) = T(1,0) = (0,1)$ and $T(\\mathbf{e}_2) = T(0,1) = (-1,0)$. Write these as columns: the matrix is $\\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{bmatrix}$. To verify: $T(3,2) = \\begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\2\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}-2\\\\3\\end{bmatrix}$ ✓. That\'s the whole algorithm — apply $T$ to each basis vector, use the outputs as columns.',
      '**Coordinates.** For a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\in V$, write $\\mathbf{v} = x_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\cdots + x_n \\mathbf{b}_n$. The coordinate vector is $[\\mathbf{v}]_{\\mathcal{B}} = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Then matrix multiplication gives: $[T(\\mathbf{v})]_{\\mathcal{C}} = [T]_{\\mathcal{B}}^{\\mathcal{C}} \\cdot [\\mathbf{v}]_{\\mathcal{B}}$. This is the fundamental formula: matrices multiply coordinate vectors.',
      '**Change of basis.** If $T: V \\to V$ (same space) and you switch from basis $\\mathcal{B}$ to basis $\\mathcal{B}\'$, the matrix changes by conjugation: $[T]_{\\mathcal{B}\'} = P^{-1}[T]_{\\mathcal{B}}P$, where $P$ is the **change-of-basis matrix** — its $j$-th column is $[\\mathbf{b}_j]_{\\mathcal{B}\'} =$ coordinates of the old basis vectors in the new basis. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ represent the same linear map in different bases iff $B = P^{-1}AP$ for some invertible $P$.',
      '**The matrix is always constructed the same way.** To build $[T]_{\\mathcal{B}}^{\\mathcal{C}}$ step by step: (1) Apply $T$ to the first basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_1$ to get $T(\\mathbf{b}_1) \\in W$. (2) Express $T(\\mathbf{b}_1)$ as a linear combination of the $\\mathcal{C}$ basis vectors. (3) Write the coefficients as the first column of the matrix. Repeat for each basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{b}_n$. The columns go left to right, one per input basis vector. This construction works for any two vector spaces and any two bases — including polynomial spaces, function spaces, and matrix spaces.',
      '**Similar matrices share invariants.** Since $B = P^{-1}AP$ represents the same linear map in a different basis, any property of the map that does not depend on the choice of basis is preserved. These are called **similarity invariants**: $\\det(A) = \\det(B)$ (determinant is basis-free), $\\text{tr}(A) = \\text{tr}(B)$ (trace is basis-free), and the characteristic polynomial $\\det(\\lambda I - A) = \\det(\\lambda I - B)$ (eigenvalues are basis-free). This is why eigenvalues are intrinsic to the linear map, not to its matrix representation.',
      '**The DFT is a change of basis.** The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a change of basis in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ — from the standard basis (sample values in time) to the Fourier basis (complex exponentials $e^{2\\pi i k/n}$). In the Fourier basis, convolution (which is a complicated sum in the time basis) becomes pointwise multiplication (trivial). The DFT matrix $F$ is the change-of-basis matrix: $F_{jk} = e^{2\\pi i jk/n}/\\sqrt{n}$. This is why FFT-based convolution is so much faster than direct convolution — the right basis makes the computation trivial.',
      '**Where this is heading.** Once you understand that every linear map is represented by a matrix, and that changing the basis changes the matrix by $P^{-1}AP$, diagonalization becomes simple to interpret: finding a basis in which $A$ is diagonal is exactly finding a basis in which the map just scales each direction independently. The next lesson (isomorphisms) formalizes when two spaces are "the same" — meaning there is a bijective linear map between them — which connects directly to when two matrix representations are interchangeable.',
