      "A population of bacteria doubles every hour. After 24 hours starting from 1 bacterium, how many are there? The answer — 16,777,216 — is why exponential growth is called explosive. But what makes the function $f(t) = 2^t$ so fundamentally different from $f(t) = t^2$?",

      "Exponential functions model anything that grows or decays at a rate proportional to its current size: compound interest, radioactive decay, viral spread, cooling of a hot object, charging of a capacitor. In manufacturing, the learning curve — the observation that production cost drops by a fixed percentage each time cumulative output doubles — is an exponential relationship. Every one of these models uses the same family of functions.",

      "**Where you are in the story:** You are coming from Precalc-3 (Trigonometry), where functions were defined by ratios of sides in triangles and wrapped around the unit circle. Now the story shifts to a completely different kind of function — one where the variable lives in the exponent, not the base. That single change transforms the entire shape of the curve and its behavior.",
      "In $f(x) = b^x$, the variable $x$ is in the exponent and $b$ is a constant called the base. This is the opposite of power functions like $x^b$ where the variable is the base. The distinction matters enormously: $x^2$ grows like a parabola, but $2^x$ eventually overtakes any polynomial, no matter how high the degree.",
      "The base $b$ determines everything about the shape. When $b > 1$, the function grows — each unit increase in $x$ multiplies the output by $b$. This is multiplicative growth, which is why it accelerates so dramatically. When $0 < b < 1$, the function decays — each unit increase in $x$ multiplies the output by a fraction less than 1.",
      "Every exponential function $f(x) = b^x$ passes through $(0, 1)$ because $b^0 = 1$ for any valid base. The $x$-axis is a horizontal asymptote: the function approaches but never touches it. For growth functions, as $x \\to -\\infty$; for decay functions, as $x \\to +\\infty$.",
      '**Where this is heading:** Next you will meet $e$ and $\\ln$ — where the choice of base $e \\approx 2.71828$ turns out to be the one that makes all calculus simplest. You will also meet logarithms: the operation that "undoes" exponentiation, and the key to solving any equation where the unknown is trapped in an exponent.',

Since the values are converging (not jumping around, not oscillating wildly, not growing without bound), they must converge to **some limit**.

Let me call this limit by a name. Mathematicians have agreed to call this special number **e**, after Euler:

$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = e$$

From my calculations, I can estimate: **e ≈ 2.71828...**

This is not a rational number (not a fraction of integers). In fact, e is **irrational** — its decimal expansion goes on forever without repeating. It's like π or √2.

I want to find the limit as n → ∞. Let me make a substitution to connect this to my newly discovered limit.

Let $m = \\frac{n}{r}$, so $n = mr$. Then:

$$\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} = \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{mr}\\right)^{mr \\cdot t} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{mrt}$$

I can rewrite this as:

$$\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{mrt} = \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m \\right]^{rt}$$

Now, as n → ∞, what happens to m? Since $m = \\frac{n}{r}$ and n → ∞, we have m → ∞.

But I know what happens when m → ∞:

$$\\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m = e$$

Therefore:

$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m \\right]^{rt} = e^{rt}$$

$$A = P e^{rt}$$

I need to compute $e^{0.05}$. Using e ≈ 2.718281:

$$e^{0.05} \\approx 1.051271$$

So:

$$A \\approx 1000 \\times 1.051271 = £1051.27$$

The continuous amount exactly matches daily compounding! The formula works. 

**What's the intuition?** As I compound more frequently, the total grows. But each step of growth gives smaller increments (because each short period has smaller interest). The limit — the point where the process becomes perfectly smooth — is this exponential formula with base e.`,

This isn't arbitrary. This limit emerges naturally whenever:
- A quantity grows continuously at a constant rate
- A small percentage is applied repeatedly over many intervals
- A smooth process is modeled as the limit of discrete steps

**The four-step process:**

1. **Simplify:** Set P = 1, r = 1, t = 1 to get $(1 + 1/n)^n$
2. **Compute numerically:** Build a table for n = 1, 2, 10, 100, 1000, 1,000,000, ...

4. **Name the limit:** Call it e — Euler's number

**The payoff: continuous compounding formula**

$$A = P e^{rt}$$

This is *not* an arbitrary formula. It's the mathematical expression of the limit we discovered.

**Why this matters:** e appears when continuous growth emerges as the limit of discrete compounding. This same phenomenon appears in population dynamics (births per generation), radioactive decay (decays per unit time), and heat flow (temperature change per moment).

The constant e is universal because it captures the mathematical essence of continuous change.`,

You are a young banker named Jacob. Your job is simple: calculate compound interest on loans. A merchant borrows £1000 at 5% annual interest. How much does he owe after 1 year?

The formula is straightforward: £1000 × 1.05 = £1050.

But the merchant asks: "What if interest is compounded monthly?" Now you must calculate: £1000 × (1 + 0.05/12)^12 ≈ £1051.16

The merchant smiles. "And what about daily compounding?" £1000 × (1 + 0.05/365)^365 ≈ £1051.27

You see the pattern. More frequent compounding means more money. But how far can this go? What if interest compounded every hour? Every minute? Every second?

You ask yourself: what is the limit as compounding becomes infinitely frequent? Is there a maximum amount of money this loan can generate?`,

exists. He calls this limit "e" — the first letter of "exponential."

But your banking problem is more complex. You have:

Newton shows you how to solve this. Let m = n/r. Then:

$$\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{r \\cdot m \\cdot t}$$

As n → ∞, m → ∞. So:
