    question: 'In 1950 the world population was 2.5 billion. In 2000 it was 6.1 billion. Assuming exponential growth, what would it be in 2050? And why does this model eventually break down?',
    realWorldContext: 'Exponential models describe the first phase of almost every growth or decay process. A bacteria colony, a chain reaction, a viral post, a rumour — all grow exponentially when resources are unlimited. But resources are never unlimited forever, which is why logistic models (which cap at a carrying capacity) better describe long-run behaviour. In manufacturing, exponential decay describes equipment degradation, signal attenuation in cables, and the discharge of a capacitor. In pharmacology, drug concentration in the bloodstream follows exponential decay between doses.',

      'The general exponential model is $A(t) = A_0 e^{kt}$, where $A_0$ is the initial amount at $t=0$, $k$ is the growth rate constant, and $t$ is time. When $k > 0$, the quantity grows. When $k < 0$, it decays. The constant $k$ is not a percentage rate — it is the instantaneous relative rate of change, meaning $k = A\'(t)/A(t)$ at every instant.',
      'To find $k$ from data: you need two data points $(t_1, A_1)$ and $(t_2, A_2)$. Write $A_1 = A_0 e^{kt_1}$ and $A_2 = A_0 e^{kt_2}$. Divide the equations to eliminate $A_0$: $A_2/A_1 = e^{k(t_2-t_1)}$. Take $\\ln$ of both sides and solve for $k$. This is the standard procedure — eliminate the unknown you do not want first.',
      'Half-life ($T_{1/2}$) is the time for a decaying quantity to halve: $\\frac{1}{2} = e^{kT_{1/2}} \\Rightarrow T_{1/2} = -\\ln 2 / k$ (negative because $k < 0$ for decay). Doubling time ($T_d$) is analogous for growth: $2 = e^{kT_d} \\Rightarrow T_d = \\ln 2 / k$. Both depend only on $k$, not on $A_0$ — the starting amount does not change how fast the process happens.',
