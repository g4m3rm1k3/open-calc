      "**Let's place you exactly where you are in the course.** In Chapter 0, you learned that the slope of a line between two points is \u0394y/\u0394x. In Chapter 1, you learned that a limit is what a function approaches as its input gets close to a value. Both of those ideas were preparation for this exact moment. The derivative IS the limit of the slope formula. That’s it. The difference quotient [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h is \u0394y/\u0394x with \u0394x = h. The derivative is what that ratio approaches as h \u2192 0. You already know both halves — this lesson puts them together.",

      "Start with something we already understand: average rate of change. If you drive 120 miles in 2 hours, your average speed is 60 mph. If a population grows from 1,000 to 1,500 individuals over 5 years, the average growth rate is 100 individuals per year. In each case, we compute (change in output) divided by (change in input). This is the slope of the line connecting two points on the graph — called a secant line.",
      "Formally, the average rate of change of a function f over the interval from x = a to x = a + h is the slope of the secant line through the points (a, f(a)) and (a+h, f(a+h)). We write this as [f(a+h) - f(a)] / h. This expression has a name: the difference quotient. It is the single most important formula in differential calculus.",
      "Now ask: what happens as h gets smaller and smaller? The second point (a+h, f(a+h)) slides along the curve toward (a, f(a)). The secant line that once crossed the curve at two distinct points begins to rotate. In the limit, as h approaches 0, the secant line approaches a unique limiting position — the tangent line. The slope of that tangent line is the derivative.",
      "Here is why we cannot simply plug in h = 0 directly. At h = 0, the difference quotient becomes [f(a) - f(a)] / 0 = 0/0, which is the indeterminate form from Chapter 1. This is not a number — it is a failure of division. But taking the LIMIT as h approaches 0 is something entirely different from evaluating AT h = 0. The limit asks: what value does the expression approach as h gets arbitrarily close to 0? That question has a perfectly well-defined, finite answer for most functions.",
      "Think about what the difference quotient measures geometrically. The numerator f(a+h) - f(a) is the vertical rise from one point to the other. The denominator h is the horizontal run. So the ratio is rise over run — the slope of the secant line. As h shrinks, the two points get closer and closer together, but the slope of the line between them settles into a limiting value. That limiting slope is the derivative.",
      "The derivative tells us two things simultaneously, and they are really the same thing: (1) it is the slope of the curve at the point x = a, meaning the slope of the tangent line to the graph there, and (2) it is the instantaneous rate of change of the function at x = a. If f(t) is position, the derivative is instantaneous velocity. If f(x) is a population, the derivative is the instantaneous growth rate. If f(x) is profit as a function of units sold, the derivative is marginal profit.",
      "Mathematicians have invented several notations for the derivative, each with its own strengths. If y = f(x), then the derivative can be written as f'(x) (read \"f prime of x\", due to Lagrange), or as dy/dx (Leibniz notation, emphasizing the ratio of infinitesimal changes), or as d/dx[f(x)] (operator notation), or as Df(x) (operator notation due to Euler), or even as y\u0307 (Newton's dot notation, used in physics for time derivatives). All of these mean exactly the same thing: the limit of the difference quotient. Leibniz notation dy/dx is especially useful when doing related rates and chain rule problems, because it behaves somewhat like a fraction (though it is not exactly one). Lagrange notation f'(x) is compact and convenient for most algebraic work.",

      "**Where this is heading:** You now have the definition of the derivative and you can compute it for simple functions using the limit process. But computing (x+h)^100 - x^100 from scratch every time would be unbearable. The next lesson gives you the shortcut rules — proved from limits once, then used freely. After that, every derivative you compute will take seconds instead of pages.",

      'Not every function has a derivative everywhere, and it is important to understand exactly when and why the derivative fails. There are three geometric failure modes for a continuous function. A corner is a point where the left-hand and right-hand difference quotients both converge but to different values — the classic example is f(x) = |x| at x = 0, where the left limit gives -1 and the right limit gives +1. A cusp is sharper than a corner: one or both one-sided difference quotients blow up to infinity, giving the graph a pointed tip — f(x) = x^(2/3) at x = 0 is the textbook example, where the tangent line would be vertical. A vertical tangent is a subtler case: the slope grows without bound in the same direction from both sides, so the "tangent line" would be a vertical line, which has undefined slope — f(x) = x^(1/3) at x = 0 exhibits this. In all three cases, the function is continuous but the limit of the difference quotient fails to be a finite real number, so f\'(a) does not exist.',

      "There is a profound and one-directional relationship between differentiability and continuity: differentiability always implies continuity, but continuity does NOT always imply differentiability. The proof that differentiability implies continuity is short: write f(x) - f(a) = [f(x) - f(a)] / (x - a) times (x - a). As x approaches a, the first factor approaches f'(a) (a finite number, since f is differentiable), and the second factor approaches 0. Their product approaches f'(a) times 0 = 0, so f(x) approaches f(a), which is exactly the definition of continuity. The converse fails because continuity only requires that the function has no jumps or holes — it says nothing about whether the graph has a well-defined direction (slope) at each point. The absolute value function |x| is the standard counterexample: perfectly continuous on all of R, but non-differentiable at x = 0 because of the corner.",

      "A practical checklist for differentiability: before computing a derivative, ask three questions. (1) Is the function continuous at the point? If not, it cannot be differentiable. (2) Is there a corner, cusp, or vertical tangent? If so, the derivative does not exist there. (3) Is the function defined by cases (piecewise)? At the boundary between pieces, you must check that the one-sided derivatives match. Only if all three checks pass can you proceed to compute the derivative using the limit definition or the shortcut rules.",

From the left (h → 0⁻): [|0+h| - |0|] / h = |h|/h = (-h)/h = -1, so the left-hand derivative is -1. Since 1 ≠ -1, the two-sided limit does not exist, and f is not differentiable at 0.",

First: a corner, where the left and right derivatives both exist but are unequal (example: |x| at 0).

Third: a vertical tangent, where the difference quotient grows without bound as h → 0, meaning the tangent line would be vertical (example: x^(1/3) at 0).

This isn't a rounding error or a data problem. It's a fundamental breakdown: **the average speed formula requires an interval.** A "speed at a single point in time" has no change in position and no change in time. There is nothing to divide.

For 2,000 years, this was the state of things. You could measure average speed. You could not, in any rigorous sense, measure speed at an instant. Aristotle even argued that motion at an instant was a contradiction in terms.

$$p(h) = 290h - 15h^2 \\qquad p(0) = 290(0) - 15(0)^2 = 0$$

is called the **difference quotient** (Newton called it the "method of fluxions" in the 1660s; Leibniz independently called his version "differentials").

The limit of the difference quotient as $h \\to 0$ is the **derivative** of $f$ at $t$:

$$f'(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}$$

This is the formal definition of the derivative. In our case:
- $f(t) = 290t - 15t^2$ (position)
- $f'(t)$ = instantaneous speed (velocity) at time $t$

The difference quotient is the average speed over a window of width $h$. The derivative is what that average stabilizes to as the window collapses to a point.

**Notation:** mathematicians use several equivalent symbols for the derivative:

$$f'(t) = \\frac{df}{dt} = \\frac{dp}{dt} = \\dot{f}(t)$$
