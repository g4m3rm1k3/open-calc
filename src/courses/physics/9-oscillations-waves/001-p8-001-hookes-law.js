    question:
      'You stretch a spring gently — it pulls back. You stretch it twice as far — it pulls back twice as hard. Three times as far — three times as hard. But then you stretch it too far — and suddenly it doesn\'t spring back at all. What is the law governing the first part, and what breaks it in the second?',
    realWorldContext:
      'Hooke\'s Law is the foundation of every spring, every elastic material, and every oscillating system. Suspension bridges sway with it. Atomic bonds obey it near equilibrium. Every musical instrument string vibrates because of it. Even the bonds between atoms in a solid act like tiny springs — which is why solids have a Young\'s modulus and why sound travels through them.',

      '**The law:** Within the elastic limit, the restoring force of a spring is proportional to its displacement: \\(F = -kx\\). The minus sign is crucial — it means the force always acts opposite to the displacement, pushing or pulling the spring back toward equilibrium.',

      '**The elastic limit:** The linear relationship holds only up to a certain extension. Beyond this, the material deforms permanently (plastic deformation) and Hooke\'s Law fails. A rubber band, a spring, a steel beam — all are Hookean for small deformations and non-Hookean for large ones. Physics begins with the linear region.',

      '**The spring constant k:** A stiff spring has a large k (requires more force per metre of stretch). A soft spring has a small k. Units: N/m. A car suspension spring might have k ≈ 20,000 N/m; a watch spring k ≈ 0.001 N/m; an atomic bond k ≈ 10 N/m.',

      '**Why the minus sign creates oscillation:** If you displace a mass from equilibrium, Hooke\'s Law restores it. But it overshoots — and the restoring force pulls it back again. This alternation between restoring force and overshoot is the origin of all oscillatory motion. Hooke\'s Law is the starting point for the next three lessons.',
