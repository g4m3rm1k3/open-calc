    question:
      'A 5 kg bowling ball rolls at 3 m/s. A 0.05 kg tennis ball flies at 60 m/s. Both have the same kinetic energy (check: ½(5)(9) = 22.5 J; ½(0.05)(3600) = 90 J — actually they don\'t). Revised question: the bowling ball and tennis ball both hit you. Which is harder to stop? What quantity captures "difficulty to stop" better than speed alone?',
    realWorldContext:
      'Momentum is what makes collisions dangerous. A truck at 5 m/s has far more momentum than a bicycle at 5 m/s — the truck is almost impossible to stop quickly, while the bicycle can brake in meters. Air bags, crumple zones, and safety padding all work by extending the time of collision (increasing \\(\\Delta t\\)) to reduce the force — a direct consequence of the impulse-momentum theorem.',

      '**The answer:** The bowling ball. Even though the tennis ball is faster, the bowling ball has more mass. To stop something, you need to change its velocity — but a massive object resists change more stubbornly. The quantity that captures this "inertia in motion" is **momentum**: \\(\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}\\).',

      '**Momentum is a vector:** This is crucial. Two cars at the same speed but opposite directions have momenta that add to zero — not 2mv. Two cars moving in the same direction add: total momentum = sum of individual momenta. Direction is encoded by sign in 1D, and by components in 2D/3D.',

      '**Newton\'s Second Law is really about momentum:** Newton didn\'t write \\(F = ma\\). He wrote \\(F = dp/dt\\) — force is the rate of change of momentum. For constant mass, \\(dp/dt = m(dv/dt) = ma\\), so \\(F = ma\\) is a special case. The more fundamental form handles variable-mass systems (rockets, falling chains) and explains how collision forces work.',

      '**Why momentum is conserved in collisions:** When two objects collide, the force one exerts on the other (Newton\'s Third Law) is equal and opposite. So \\(dp_1/dt = -dp_2/dt\\), meaning \\(d(p_1 + p_2)/dt = 0\\) — total momentum is constant. This holds whether the collision is gentle or violent, elastic or inelastic. It is one of the most powerful conservation laws in physics.',
