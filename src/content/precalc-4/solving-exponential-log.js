    question: 'To solve $2^x = 5$, you cannot just take a square root or factor. You need to "undo" the exponential — and that is exactly what logarithms are for. Once you know the move, every exponential equation becomes a linear or quadratic equation in disguise.',
    realWorldContext: 'Solving exponential equations is how scientists compute radioactive half-lives, how pharmacists calculate drug elimination times, and how financial analysts find the time for an investment to reach a target. Solving logarithmic equations appears in chemistry (pH calculations), acoustics (decibel levels), and seismology (Richter magnitudes). The same two algebraic moves — take a log, or exponentiate — unlock all of these.',

      '**Where you are in the story:** You have built up the full toolkit: exponential functions, their inverse logarithms, the natural base $e$ and $\\ln$, and the three log properties. Now all of that pays off in one place — solving the equations these functions appear in. Everything you learned was preparation for this lesson.',
      'There are two master moves. To solve an exponential equation: take the logarithm of both sides. To solve a logarithmic equation: exponentiate both sides (raise the base to each side as an exponent). These two moves are inverses of each other — each undoes what the other does.',
      'The one-to-one property makes both moves valid: if $b^x = b^y$ then $x = y$ (exponentials are one-to-one), and if $\\log_b x = \\log_b y$ then $x = y$ (logs are one-to-one). This means equal outputs imply equal inputs — the foundation for all equation solving here.',
      'Logarithmic equations require a domain check — extraneous solutions are common. After solving, substitute every answer back into the original equation. Any answer that makes a log argument non-positive is extraneous and must be discarded. Exponential equations have no extraneous solutions because $b^x > 0$ always.',
      '**Where this is heading:** The final lesson in this chapter applies these exact solving techniques to real-world models — population growth, radioactive decay, Newton\'s law of cooling. Every real application reduces to exactly the equations you are practicing here.',
