    question: 'If $2^x = 8$, you can see by inspection that $x = 3$. But if $2^x = 10$, what is $x$? There is no clean answer — yet the question is completely well-posed. Logarithms were invented precisely to answer it: $x = \\log_2 10 \\approx 3.32$.',
    realWorldContext: 'Logarithms compress enormous ranges into manageable numbers. The Richter scale for earthquakes, decibels for sound, pH for acidity, and stellar magnitude for brightness — all use logarithmic scales because the underlying phenomena span factors of millions. A magnitude-7 earthquake releases roughly 32 times the energy of a magnitude-6 earthquake. Logarithms make these relationships linear and intuitive. In CS, $\\log_2 n$ appears in binary search, merge sort, and tree height — anywhere you repeatedly halve a problem.',

      '**Where you are in the story:** In the previous lesson you met exponential functions $f(x) = b^x$ and saw how they model explosive growth and decay. But those models all contain an unknown in the exponent — and you cannot solve for an exponent using algebra alone. Logarithms are the inverse operation invented for exactly that purpose.',
      'The logarithm is defined as the inverse of the exponential. $\\log_b x = y$ means exactly the same thing as $b^y = x$. Reading it: "the logarithm base $b$ of $x$ is $y$" — meaning "$b$ raised to the power $y$ gives $x$." The logarithm asks: what exponent do we need?',
      'Because it is the inverse of $b^x$, the graph of $y = \\log_b x$ is the reflection of $y = b^x$ over the line $y = x$. Everything flips: the horizontal asymptote $y = 0$ of the exponential becomes a vertical asymptote $x = 0$ of the logarithm. The $y$-intercept $(0, 1)$ of the exponential becomes the $x$-intercept $(1, 0)$ of the logarithm. The domain of the exponential ($-\\infty, \\infty$) becomes the range of the logarithm — and vice versa.',
      'The domain of $\\log_b x$ is $(0, \\infty)$ — you can only take the log of a positive number. This is not arbitrary: $b^y$ is always positive for any $b > 0$, so the output of the exponential (which becomes the input of the logarithm) is always positive. $\\log_b 0$ and $\\log_b(-5)$ are undefined over the reals.',
      '**Where this is heading:** Once you understand the log as an inverse, the log properties in the next lesson become obvious — they are just exponent laws translated into log notation. And in the lesson after that, the natural log $\\ln$ emerges as the special case that makes all of calculus clean.',
