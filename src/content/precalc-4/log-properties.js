    question: 'Why does $\\log(AB) = \\log A + \\log B$? This looks like a miracle until you remember that logarithms are exponents — and when you multiply powers of the same base, you add exponents. Every log property is that observation, dressed up in log notation.',
    realWorldContext: 'Log properties are why slide rules worked: multiplying two numbers was done by adding their logarithms, then reading off the antilog. Before electronic calculators, this was how engineers, navigators, and scientists performed complex multiplication in seconds. Today, log properties are used to linearise multiplicative models — taking the log of a power law $y = ax^b$ gives $\\ln y = \\ln a + b\\ln x$, a linear relationship that is easy to fit to data.',

      '**Where you are in the story:** You have met exponential functions and their inverses, the logarithms. Now the question is: how do you actually work with logarithms in practice? The answer is a set of three rules that reduce any complicated log expression to a sum of simple ones — and every rule is just an exponent law translated into log language.',
      'Every log property comes from the corresponding exponent law. The product rule $\\log_b(MN) = \\log_b M + \\log_b N$ mirrors $b^m \\cdot b^n = b^{m+n}$. The quotient rule $\\log_b(M/N) = \\log_b M - \\log_b N$ mirrors $b^m / b^n = b^{m-n}$. The power rule $\\log_b(M^p) = p\\log_b M$ mirrors $(b^m)^p = b^{mp}$. Once you see this connection, the properties are not rules to memorise — they are consequences of something you already know.',
      'Expanding a logarithm means breaking it into a sum/difference of simpler logs using these properties. Condensing means running the properties in reverse to combine multiple logs into a single log. Both operations are the same rules — just different directions.',
      'The change of base formula $\\log_b x = \\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln b} = \\frac{\\log x}{\\log b}$ lets you compute any logarithm using only the ln or log button on a calculator. It also reveals a beautiful fact: all logarithm functions of the same shape are just vertical scalings of each other. $\\log_b x = \\frac{1}{\\ln b} \\cdot \\ln x$ — they are all multiples of $\\ln x$.',
      '**Where this is heading:** Log properties are the engine that makes solving exponential and logarithmic equations tractable. In the next two lessons you will use these rules constantly — especially the power rule (to bring exponents down) and the product/quotient rules (to condense multiple log terms before exponentiating). Later, in calculus, these same properties enable logarithmic differentiation.',
