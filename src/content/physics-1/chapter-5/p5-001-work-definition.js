    question: 'A weightlifter holds a 100 kg barbell perfectly still above their head for 3 minutes — arms shaking, muscles burning. According to physics, exactly how much work have they done on the barbell? Make a genuine guess before reading on.',
    realWorldContext:
      'Your intuitive sense of "effort" and physics "work" are deliberately different things. Physics work measures one specific thing: energy transferred into an object\'s motion or position change. When that transfer is zero, the work is zero — regardless of how hard you tried. This is not pedantic. It is the key to understanding where energy goes in every engine, every machine, and every biological system.',

      '**The answer that surprises everyone:** The weightlifter has done exactly zero joules of work on the barbell. The barbell didn\'t move — displacement is zero — so no energy was transferred to its motion or position. The muscles burned ATP (biological energy), but that energy became heat and muscle tension, not mechanical work on the barbell. Biology and physics measure "work" differently on purpose.',

      '**Push a concrete wall.** You push with maximum force. The wall doesn\'t move. Displacement: zero. Work done on the wall: zero. Exhausting yourself without moving something is not work in physics. This forces the question: what exactly *is* work?',

      '**The contradiction that builds the model:** If a horse pulls a cart along a flat road, work is done. If the same horse stands motionless in harness, no work is done. If a roller coaster car rolls along a horizontal track, gravity (pointing down) does no work — because gravity is perpendicular to the motion. The pattern emerging: work requires both force AND displacement, and only the force component *in the direction of motion* counts.',

      '**Building the rule:** We need a formula capturing: (1) more force → more work, (2) more displacement → more work, (3) force aligned with motion → maximum work, (4) force perpendicular → zero work. There is exactly one product of two vectors that behaves this way: the **dot product**. Math doesn\'t impose this — physics demands it, and the dot product is the compression that satisfies all four conditions at once.',
