    question:
      'A police officer shows you a position-time graph from a speed camera. The graph is a steep straight line going upward. You don\'t know the equation. You don\'t need it. Just by looking at the slope of the line, you can instantly tell:this car was moving fast and at constant speed. If the graph curves upward, it was accelerating. If it\'s flat, the car was stopped. Every physics graph is a picture of the motion — if you know how to read it. What does every feature of an x-t or v-t graph tell you?',

Physicists read particle trajectories from detector readouts. In all of these: understanding what slopes and areas mean is the fundamental skill.

      '**The x–t graph: slope = velocity. **On a position-vs-time graph (x on the vertical axis, t on the horizontal),the slope of the curve at any point equals the instantaneous velocity at that moment. Steep positive slope → moving fast in the positive direction. Zero slope (horizontal) → momentarily stopped or at constant position. Steep negative slope → moving fast in the negative direction. Curved upward (increasing slope) → speeding up. Curved downward (decreasing slope) → slowing down.',

      '**The v–t graph: slope = acceleration, area = displacement. **On a velocity-vs-time graph, the slope at any point equals the instantaneous acceleration. But there is a second tool: the **area under the v–t graph** equals displacement. A rectangle of width Δt and height v gives displacement v·Δt. Many rectangles stacked up approximate the total displacement over any interval. As the rectangles shrink to zero width — this is the integral. No calculus notation needed yet: just "area under the curve equals displacement."',

      '**Reading motion stories from graphs. **Every x–t or v–t graph tells a story. A flat x–t line: the object is at rest. A straight x–t line with positive slope: constant positive velocity. A parabolic x–t curve opening upward: constant positive acceleration from rest. A straight v–t line with negative slope: constant deceleration. A v–t graph touching zero and bouncing: the object turned around (direction reversed). Reading these patterns is faster than solving equations — and builds intuition that equations alone cannot give.',

      '**The twin graphs — x–t and v–t together. **The x–t and v–t graphs are linked by the slope relationship. Wherever x–t has zero slope, the v–t graph crosses zero. Wherever x–t has maximum slope, v–t has its maximum value. Wherever x–t is a parabola, v–t is a straight line. Looking at both graphs simultaneously — one describes position, the other its rate of change — gives a complete picture of the motion.',
