    question:
      `In 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter a 327 million spacecraft — because one engineering team reported thruster force in pound-force seconds, and another team's software expected newton-seconds. Nobody caught it. The spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere at the wrong angle and burned up. A $327 million mistake caused by a unit mismatch. How does something this simple destroy a spacecraft — and how do you make sure it never happens to you?`,
    realWorldContext:
      `Units are not administrative overhead. They are physical reality encoded in mathematics. Every number in physics is incomplete without a unit — "9.8" means nothing; "9.8 m/s²" is a specific claim about the universe. Dimensional analysis — tracking units through every calculation — is the single fastest way to find algebra errors, check whether an equation could possibly be right, and convert between measurement systems. Engineers, physicists, chemists, and pharmacists all use it daily. You will use it in every chapter of this course.`,

    prose: [
      `**Every number in physics has a physical type — its dimension.** The dimension of a quantity tells you *what kind of thing it is*: a length, a time, a mass, a speed. The unit tells you *how big your measuring stick is*: meters vs feet, seconds vs hours. You can change units freely — 1 meter = 100 centimeters — but you cannot change dimension: a length is always a length, never a time. When an equation adds a length to a time, something has gone catastrophically wrong.`,

      `**The SI system — the universal language of physics.** The International System of Units (SI) defines seven base units from which every other unit is built. In mechanics, you need exactly three: the **meter** [m] for length, the **kilogram** [kg] for mass, and the **second** [s] for time. Every mechanics quantity — velocity, force, energy, pressure — is a combination of these three. Velocity: [m/s]. Acceleration: [m/s²]. Force: [kg·m/s²] (which we call a Newton). Energy: [kg·m²/s²] (which we call a Joule). Learning these combinations is not memorization — it is understanding what the quantity *is*.`,

      `**Dimensional analysis: the most powerful error-checking tool in physics.** Here is the central rule: **both sides of every equation must have the same dimension**. If the left side is a length [m] and the right side comes out to [m/s], the equation is wrong — period. No amount of numerical cleverness can fix a dimensional mismatch. This means you can check any equation you derive, without knowing the answer, just by tracking units. It is a complete, automatic error-detector.`,

      `**Unit conversion: multiply by 1, cleverly.** Converting between units is just multiplication by a cleverly written "1". 1 minute = 60 seconds, so (1 min / 60 s) = 1. Multiply any quantity by this fraction and you change the label without changing the physical value. 60 km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s) = 16.67 m/s. Every unit except the one you want cancels — like factors in algebra. Set it up so the unit you are removing appears in the denominator of the conversion factor, and the unit you want appears in the numerator. Then cancel.`,

      `**Order of magnitude: knowing when to care about precision.** Not all problems need 6 decimal places. A rough estimate within a factor of 10 is often enough to check feasibility, catch blunders, or choose a method. The mass of a car is "about 1,000 kg" — whether it is 980 kg or 1,100 kg rarely matters in a first calculation. This is called an **order of magnitude** estimate. Galileo, Fermi, and Einstein all used them constantly. A physicist who insists on 5 significant figures for a rough estimate wastes time; one who ignores units entirely destroys spacecraft.`,
