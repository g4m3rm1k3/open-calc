    question: 'A plane flies northeast at 400 km/h while wind blows due east at 80 km/h. What is the plane\'s actual velocity? You cannot add 400 + 80 because the directions are different. Vectors are the tool for adding quantities that have both size and direction.',
    realWorldContext: 'Force, velocity, acceleration, electric and magnetic fields — all are vector quantities. In structural engineering, every joint in a truss has forces acting on it in multiple directions; they must balance as vectors. In robotics, a robotic arm is described by joint angles and link lengths — the tip position is computed by adding vectors. In game physics, every collision, every trajectory, every lighting calculation is a vector operation.',

      '**Where you are in the story:** You have mastered exponentials and logarithms (Precalc-4). Now the chapter turns to quantities that cannot be fully described by a single number — quantities that have both size and direction. Vectors are the language for this, and every physics, engineering, and graphics application uses them.',
      'A vector is an arrow. It has a tail (where it starts) and a tip (where it ends). Its magnitude is the length of the arrow. Its direction is which way the arrow points. Two vectors are equal if they have the same length and the same direction — position in the plane does not matter. You can slide the arrow anywhere and it is still the same vector.',
      'Adding two vectors follows the tip-to-tail rule: place the tail of the second vector at the tip of the first. The result (the resultant) goes from the first tail to the second tip. Order does not matter — $\\vec{u} + \\vec{v} = \\vec{v} + \\vec{u}$ because the diagonal of the parallelogram is the same regardless of which side you traverse first.',
      'Component form $\\langle a, b \\rangle$ is just the arrow described by its horizontal and vertical shadows. The component $a$ is how far the arrow goes right, and $b$ is how far it goes up. Once you have components, vector addition becomes ordinary addition: $\\langle a_1, b_1 \\rangle + \\langle a_2, b_2 \\rangle = \\langle a_1+a_2, b_1+b_2 \\rangle$. Adding the shadows gives the shadow of the resultant.',
      'Walk 3 km north, then 4 km east. Where are you? Not 7 km from the start — you are 5 km from the start (Pythagoras: $\\sqrt{9+16}=5$) at some angle northeast. Your total displacement is a vector: it has the magnitude 5 km and a direction. This is exactly what vector addition computes. The north walk is $\\langle 0, 3\\rangle$ and the east walk is $\\langle 4, 0\\rangle$. Their sum is $\\langle 4, 3\\rangle$, magnitude $\\sqrt{16+9}=5$ km. The path you took (north then east) does not matter — only the net displacement (the resultant arrow) does. This is also why the commutative law holds: walking north then east puts you in the same place as walking east then north.',
      '**Where this is heading:** Once you can add vectors and find their magnitudes, you will learn a new operation — the dot product — that measures how much two vectors agree in direction. That opens the door to projections, work in physics, and eventually the gradient in calculus.',
