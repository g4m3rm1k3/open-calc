    question: 'A radar operator sees a plane at distance 120 km, bearing 045°. Nobody converts that to $(x, y)$ before plotting — the distance-and-angle description IS the natural language. Why does the choice of coordinate system matter so much?',
    realWorldContext: 'Polar coordinates are native to anything that rotates or radiates outward: radar, sonar, radio antennas, robotic arms, turbines, circular saws. The equation of a circle centred at the origin is $x^2+y^2=r^2$ in Cartesian — complicated. In polar it is simply $r=5$ — trivial. The system whose equations are simplest is the one you should use. Choosing well is an engineering skill, not just a mathematical one.',

      '**Where you are in the story:** You have learned to describe vectors with components — the "right and up" language of Cartesian coordinates. Now you learn a second language for the same point: distance and direction from the origin. This is polar coordinates, and it will feel immediately familiar because it uses the same right triangle you already know.',
      'Every point in the plane has two addresses. The Cartesian address says: walk $x$ units right, then $y$ units up. The polar address says: face angle $\\theta$ from the positive $x$-axis, then walk $r$ units in that direction. Both addresses are complete — they locate the same point. The triangle connecting these two descriptions is an ordinary right triangle, and the conversion formulas are just the sides of that triangle.',
      'The conversion is not a formula to memorise — it is a right triangle to draw. Drop a perpendicular from your point to the $x$-axis. The hypotenuse is $r$ (the polar distance). The horizontal leg is $x$ (= $r\\cos\\theta$ by definition of cosine). The vertical leg is $y$ (= $r\\sin\\theta$ by definition of sine). Going the other way: $r$ is the hypotenuse of that triangle ($r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ by Pythagoras), and $\\theta$ is the angle at the origin ($\\tan\\theta = y/x$).',
      'A polar address is not unique, which surprises most students. Adding $360°$ to the angle returns to the same point. A negative $r$ means "walk in the opposite direction from $\\theta$." So $(3, 60°)$, $(3, 420°)$, and $(-3, 240°)$ all describe the same point. This non-uniqueness is a feature — it gives flexibility when writing polar equations.',
      'Radar returns an echo with a time (which gives distance $r$) and a direction (which gives angle $\\theta$). The natural output is $(r, \\theta)$. Converting to $(x, y)$ for plotting would require a trigonometric computation for every single detected object — wasteful and error-prone. Polar coordinates are the native representation. Wind direction is always given as a bearing and speed. Navigational charts show distance and bearing. All of these are polar systems. The key insight: polar coordinates are the natural choice when the problem has a natural centre (radar antenna, observer, star) and when distance from that centre matters more than position on a grid.',
      '**Where this is heading:** Complex numbers in polar form (next lesson) use this same $(r, \\theta)$ language — the modulus is $r$ and the argument is $\\theta$. In calculus, area integrals over circular regions convert to $dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$, often turning a hard integral into an easy one.',
